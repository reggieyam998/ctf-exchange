- **BeaconProxy**: ~1,069,016 gas per proxy
- **MockImplementation**: ~317,955 gas

## 🔄 Upgrade Process

### Before Beacon Pattern (Polymarket Current)
```
1. Market contract upgraded to new address
2. Existing proxy wallets become obsolete
3. Users must migrate to new proxy wallets
4. Complex user experience, address changes
5. Fragmented system (old + new proxies)
```

### After Beacon Pattern (Our Implementation)
```
1. Market contract upgraded to new address
2. Beacon upgraded to new implementation
3. All proxy wallets automatically use new implementation
4. Seamless user experience, no address changes
5. Unified system with single upgrade point
```

## 🎯 Problem Solved

### Critical Issue Addressed
**Market Contract Upgrade Scenario**: When the main market contract (exchange) is upgraded to a new address, existing proxy wallets become obsolete because they still point to the old implementation.

### Solution Implemented
**Beacon Proxy Pattern**: All proxy wallets read their implementation from a centralized beacon contract. When the market contract upgrades:

1. **Single Upgrade Point**: Only the beacon needs to be upgraded
2. **Automatic Propagation**: All proxies automatically use new implementation
3. **No User Migration**: Users keep their existing proxy addresses
4. **Seamless Experience**: No interruption to user operations
