## Proxy Wallet Architecture

### Problem Statement

When a market contract (exchange) is upgraded to a new address, existing proxy wallets become obsolete because they still point to the old implementation. This creates a critical user experience issue where users lose access to their trading capabilities.

### Proxy Wallet Upgrade Approaches

#### Approach 1: Factory-Based Upgrades (Current Polymarket)

**How it works:**
```solidity
// From CTFExchange.sol
function setProxyFactory(address _newProxyFactory) external onlyAdmin {
    _setProxyFactory(_newProxyFactory);
}

function setSafeFactory(address _newSafeFactory) external onlyAdmin {
    _setSafeFactory(_newSafeFactory);
}
```

**Architecture:**
```
User Proxy → Factory → Implementation → Market Contract
```

**Upgrade Process:**
1. Admin deploys new factory with new implementation
2. Admin calls `setProxyFactory(newFactory)`
3. New proxies use new factory/implementation
4. Old proxies continue using old factory/implementation

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Proven in Production**: Used by Polymarket
- ✅ **Backwards Compatible**: Supports existing system
- ✅ **Gradual Migration**: Can migrate users over time
- ✅ **Simple Implementation**: Easy to understand and implement

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Doesn't Solve Upgrade Problem**: Existing proxies become obsolete
- ❌ **Complex User Experience**: Users need to migrate to new proxies
- ❌ **Address Changes**: New proxy addresses for all users
- ❌ **Fragmented System**: Old and new proxies coexist

#### Approach 2: Beacon Proxy Pattern (Our Solution)

**How it works:**
```solidity
// Beacon contract that can be upgraded
contract ExchangeBeacon {
    address public implementation;
    address public admin;
    
    function upgradeTo(address newImplementation) external onlyAdmin {
        implementation = newImplementation;
        emit Upgraded(newImplementation);
    }
}

// Proxy wallets that read from beacon
contract BeaconProxy {
    address public beacon;
    
    function _implementation() internal view returns (address) {
        return ExchangeBeacon(beacon).implementation();
    }
}
```

**Architecture:**
```
User Proxy → Beacon → Implementation → Market Contract
```

**Upgrade Process:**
1. Admin deploys new implementation
2. Admin calls `beacon.upgradeTo(newImplementation)`
3. All proxies automatically use new implementation
4. No user action required

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Solves Upgrade Problem**: All proxies automatically updated
- ✅ **Seamless User Experience**: No migration required
- ✅ **Single Upgrade Point**: One beacon upgrade affects all proxies
- ✅ **Predictable**: Deterministic proxy addresses unchanged
- ✅ **Gas Efficient**: Minimal proxy pattern maintained

**Cons:**
- ❌ **More Complex**: Requires beacon contract
- ❌ **New Pattern**: Different from Polymarket's approach
- ❌ **Centralized Control**: Single beacon controls all proxies

#### Approach 3: UUPS Upgradeable Proxies

**How it works:**
```solidity
contract UpgradeableProxy {
    address public implementation;
    address public admin;
    
    function upgradeTo(address newImplementation) external onlyAdmin {
        implementation = newImplementation;
        emit Upgraded(newImplementation);
    }
}
```

**Architecture:**
```
User Proxy → Implementation → Market Contract
```

**Upgrade Process:**
1. Admin deploys new implementation
2. Admin calls `proxy.upgradeTo(newImplementation)` for each proxy
3. Each proxy upgraded individually
4. Users may need to approve upgrades

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Individual Control**: Each proxy can be upgraded separately
- ✅ **Flexible**: Different proxies can use different implementations
- ✅ **Standard Pattern**: Well-established upgradeable proxy pattern

**Cons:**
- ❌ **Management Overhead**: Need to upgrade each proxy individually
- ❌ **Gas Expensive**: More expensive than minimal proxies
- ❌ **Complex UX**: Users need to approve upgrades
- ❌ **Fragmented**: Different proxies may have different implementations

#### Approach 4: Factory-Based Redeployment

**How it works:**
```solidity
contract ProxyFactory {
    function createProxy(address implementation) external returns (address) {
        // Deploy new proxy with new implementation
    }
}
```

**Architecture:**
```
New User Proxy → New Factory → New Implementation → New Market Contract
```

**Upgrade Process:**
1. Admin deploys new factory with new implementation
2. Users create new proxies with new factory
3. Users migrate funds to new proxies
4. Old proxies become obsolete

**Pros:**
- ✅ **Simple**: No upgrade mechanism needed
- ✅ **Clean**: Fresh start with new implementation

**Cons:**
- ❌ **User Migration**: Users need to migrate to new proxies
- ❌ **Address Changes**: New proxy addresses for all users
- ❌ **Complex UX**: Users lose their existing proxy addresses
- ❌ **Fund Migration**: Users need to transfer funds to new proxies

### Our Analysis and Conclusion

#### Problem Analysis:
The **market contract upgrade scenario** you identified is a critical issue:
- When market contract upgrades, existing proxy wallets become obsolete
- Users lose access to their trading capabilities

#### Why Not Polymarket's Approach:

While Polymarket's factory-based approach is **proven in production**, it has **fundamental limitations**:

1. **Doesn't Solve the Upgrade Problem**: Existing proxies become obsolete when market contracts upgrade
2. **Poor User Experience**: Users need to migrate to new proxies
3. **Fragmented System**: Old and new proxies coexist, creating complexity
4. **Address Instability**: Users lose their existing proxy addresses

Our beacon pattern approach **addresses these limitations** while providing a **superior user experience** and **enterprise-grade upgrade capabilities**.

### Current Polymarket Approach

Based on [Polymarket's official documentation](https://docs.polymarket.com/developers/proxy-wallet), Polymarket uses a **dual factory system**:

#### **Deployed Addresses on Polygon Network**:
- **Gnosis Safe Factory**: `0xaacfeea03eb1561c4e67d661e40682bd20e3541b` (for MetaMask users)
- **Polymarket Proxy Factory**: `0xaB45c54AB0c941a2F231C04C3f49182e1A254052` (for MagicLink users)

#### **Architecture**:
```solidity
// From CTFExchange.sol
function setProxyFactory(address _newProxyFactory) external onlyAdmin {
    _setProxyFactory(_newProxyFactory);
}

function setSafeFactory(address _newSafeFactory) external onlyAdmin {
    _setSafeFactory(_newSafeFactory);
}
```

#### **Proxy Wallet Purpose**:
- **Asset Storage**: Holds user positions (ERC1155) and USDC (ERC20)
- **Atomic Transactions**: Enables multi-step transactions atomically
- **Relayer Support**: Supports transactions via gas station network
- **1-of-1 Multisig**: Creates single-owner multisig wallets for MetaMask users

#### **Limitations**:
- **Factory-Level Upgrades**: Admin can change factory addresses
- **New Proxies Only**: Only new proxies use new factories/implementations
- **Existing Proxies Unchanged**: Old proxies continue using old implementations
- **User Migration Required**: Users need to migrate to new proxies

### Upgrade Problem

```
Current Polymarket Flow:
User Proxy (v1) → Old Factory → Old Implementation → Old Market Contract
New User Proxy (v2) → New Factory → New Implementation → New Market Contract
```

**Problem**: When market contract upgrades, existing user proxies become obsolete.

---

## Beacon Pattern Implementation

### Solution: Beacon Proxy Pattern

We implement a **beacon proxy pattern** to solve the upgrade problem:

```solidity
// Beacon contract that can be upgraded
contract ExchangeBeacon {
    address public implementation;
    address public admin;
    
    function upgradeTo(address newImplementation) external onlyAdmin {
        implementation = newImplementation;
        emit Upgraded(newImplementation);
    }
}

// Proxy wallets that read from beacon
contract BeaconProxy {
    address public beacon;
    
    function _implementation() internal view returns (address) {
        return ExchangeBeacon(beacon).implementation();
    }
}
```

### Beacon Pattern Benefits

- ✅ **Single Upgrade Point**: Upgrade beacon once, all proxies updated
- ✅ **Seamless Upgrades**: No user migration required
- ✅ **Gas Efficient**: Minimal proxy pattern maintained
- ✅ **Backwards Compatible**: Existing proxy addresses unchanged
- ✅ **Automatic Updates**: All proxies automatically use new implementation

### Architecture Components

#### 1. ExchangeBeacon.sol
- **Centralized Control**: Single beacon controls all proxy implementations
- **Admin Functions**: Upgrade, pause, rollback capabilities
- **Security**: Multi-sig or timelock for admin control
- **Events**: Comprehensive logging for upgrades

#### 2. BeaconProxy.sol
- **Minimal Proxy**: EIP-1167 pattern for gas efficiency
- **Beacon Integration**: Reads implementation from beacon
- **Deterministic Addresses**: CREATE2 for predictable deployment
- **Owner Control**: Single EOA owner per proxy

#### 3. BeaconProxyFactory.sol
- **Factory Pattern**: Creates beacon-based proxies
- **Beacon Integration**: Factory creates proxies that use beacon
- **Gas Optimization**: Efficient proxy creation
- **Deployment Tracking**: Comprehensive event logging

### Upgrade Flow

```
Before Upgrade:
User Proxy → Beacon → Implementation v1 → Market Contract v1

After Beacon Upgrade:
User Proxy → Beacon → Implementation v2 → Market Contract v2
```

**Result**: All proxies automatically use new implementation without user action.

## Fee Collection System

### Overview

The CTF Exchange implements a sophisticated fee collection system that ensures both BUY and SELL sides pay fees to the operator while maintaining market integrity through symmetric fee calculations.

### Fee Structure

#### Fee Rate Configuration:
- **Base Fee Rate**: Configurable basis points (typically 2% = 200 bps)
- **Maximum Fee Rate**: 1000 basis points (10%) as defined in `Fees.sol`
- **Fee Recipient**: Operator (the party calling trading functions)

#### Fee Calculation by Side:

**BUY Side (receiving outcome tokens):**
```solidity
// Fee charged on Token Proceeds (outcome tokens)
fee = (feeRateBps * min(price, 1-price) * outcomeTokens) / (price * BPS_DIVISOR);
```

**SELL Side (receiving collateral):**
```solidity
// Fee charged on Collateral proceeds (USDC)
fee = feeRateBps * min(price, 1-price) * outcomeTokens / (BPS_DIVISOR * ONE);
```

### Fee Collection Process

#### 1. Fee Calculation
```solidity
// From CalculatorHelper.sol
function calculateFee(
    uint256 feeRateBps,
    uint256 outcomeTokens,
    uint256 makerAmount,
    uint256 takerAmount,
    Side side
) internal pure returns (uint256 fee)
```

#### 2. Fee Deduction
```solidity
// From Trading.sol
// Transfer order proceeds minus fees from msg.sender to order maker
_transfer(msg.sender, order.maker, takerAssetId, taking - fee);
```

#### 3. Fee Transfer to Operator
```solidity
// From Trading.sol
_chargeFee(address(this), msg.sender, takerAssetId, fee);
```

#### 4. Event Emission
```solidity
// From Trading.sol
emit FeeCharged(receiver, tokenId, fee);
```

### Asset Format by Trade Type

#### BUY Orders (receiving outcome tokens):
- **Fee Asset**: Outcome tokens
- **Example**: Buy 100 tokens @ $0.50, pay 2% = 2 outcome tokens
- **Net Receive**: 98 outcome tokens

#### SELL Orders (receiving collateral):
- **Fee Asset**: Collateral (USDC)
- **Example**: Sell 100 tokens @ $0.50, receive 50 USDC, pay 2% = 1 USDC
- **Net Receive**: 49 USDC

### Symmetric Fee Design

#### Purpose:
Fees are designed to be symmetric for complementary tokens (A and A') to preserve market integrity.

#### Implementation:
```solidity
// Uses min(price, 1-price) to ensure symmetry
uint256 price = _calculatePrice(makerAmount, takerAmount, side);
fee = feeRateBps * min(price, ONE - price) * outcomeTokens / (BPS_DIVISOR * ONE);
```

#### Benefits:
- ✅ **Market Integrity**: Prevents arbitrage between complementary positions
- ✅ **Fair Pricing**: Equal fee burden for equivalent positions
- ✅ **Predictable Costs**: Traders can calculate fees accurately

### Fee Collection Architecture

└─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └─────────────────┘
```

### Key Features

#### 1. Dual Asset Support:
- **BUY**: Fees in outcome tokens
- **SELL**: Fees in collateral (USDC)

#### 2. Operator Benefits:
- **Liquid Assets**: Receives fees in the most liquid asset for each trade
- **Immediate Value**: No need to convert between assets
- **Predictable Revenue**: Clear fee structure

#### 3. Trader Benefits:
- **Transparent Pricing**: Clear fee calculation
- **Asset Efficiency**: Pay fees in the asset they're already trading
- **Symmetric Costs**: Fair pricing for all positions

### Implementation Details

#### Fee Rate Management:
```solidity
// From Fees.sol
uint256 internal constant MAX_FEE_RATE_BIPS = 1000; // 10%

function getMaxFeeRate() public pure override returns (uint256) {
    return MAX_FEE_RATE_BIPS;
}
```

#### Fee Charging Function:
```solidity
// From Trading.sol
function _chargeFee(address payer, address receiver, uint256 tokenId, uint256 fee) internal {
    if (fee > 0) {
        _transfer(payer, receiver, tokenId, fee);
        emit FeeCharged(receiver, tokenId, fee);
    }
}
```

### Example Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: BUY 100 tokens @ $0.50 (2% fee)
- **Receive**: 100 outcome tokens
- **Fee**: 2% × 100 = 2 outcome tokens
- **Net**: 98 outcome tokens
- **Operator Receives**: 2 outcome tokens

#### Scenario 2: SELL 100 tokens @ $0.50 (2% fee)
- **Receive**: 50 USDC (100 × $0.50)
- **Fee**: 2% × 50 = 1 USDC
- **Net**: 49 USDC
- **Operator Receives**: 1 USDC

#### Scenario 3: BUY 100 tokens @ $0.10 (2% fee)
- **Receive**: 100 outcome tokens
- **Fee**: 2% × 100 = 2 outcome tokens
- **Net**: 98 outcome tokens
- **Operator Receives**: 2 outcome tokens

#### Scenario 4: SELL 100 tokens @ $0.90 (2% fee)
- **Receive**: 90 USDC (100 × $0.90)
- **Fee**: 2% × 90 = 1.8 USDC
- **Net**: 88.2 USDC
- **Operator Receives**: 1.8 USDC

### Best Practices

#### 1. Fee Rate Configuration:
- **Start Conservative**: Begin with lower fee rates (1-2%)
- **Monitor Impact**: Track trading volume and user behavior
- **Gradual Adjustment**: Increase rates gradually based on data

#### 2. Operator Management:
- **Multi-Sig Wallets**: Use multi-signature wallets for fee collection
- **Regular Withdrawals**: Schedule regular fee withdrawals
- **Asset Management**: Convert fees to stable assets as needed

#### 3. Transparency:
- **Clear Documentation**: Document fee structure clearly
- **Real-Time Display**: Show fees in trading interface
- **Historical Data**: Provide fee history and analytics

### Security Considerations

#### 1. Fee Rate Limits:
- **Maximum Rate**: Hard-coded maximum of 10%
- **Admin Controls**: Only admins can modify fee structures
- **Audit Trail**: Log all fee rate changes

#### 2. Fee Collection Security:
- **Operator Validation**: Verify operator addresses
- **Asset Validation**: Ensure correct asset transfers
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive fee event logging

#### 3. Market Integrity:
- **Symmetric Design**: Maintain fee symmetry for complementary positions
- **Arbitrage Prevention**: Prevent fee-based arbitrage opportunities
- **Price Impact**: Minimize fee impact on market prices
